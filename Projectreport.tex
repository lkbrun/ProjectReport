\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{Here we are talking about the background for the report, why we are writing it and what we hope to accomplice.}

\section{Motivation}
In todays software world, security is more important than ever. Every week there is a new threat that needs to be handled. Because of this many tools and frameworks for analysing software have been created. These tools help software developers or security experts find weaknesses or flaws in their applications. We will in this report introduce two of the best tools out there, as well as testing them out on a actual codebase. 
\paragraph{•}
The codebase we will be using is dhis2(Short explanation about dhis2). By analysing this codebase we hope that we can uncover potential security holes in the application which we than can come up with solutions for.
